### The Granular Drag on Growth (JOB MARKET PAPER)

This paper develops a simple theory linking firm granularity to productivity growth. I show that when production is concentrated in a few large firms, idiosyncratic shocks generate smaller reallocation gains, an effect that I term the granular drag on growth. I formalize this mechanism in a multi-sector model where granular firms experience stochastic productivity shocks. In efficient economies, higher sales concentration lowers expected sectoral growth by reducing the gains from reallocation. With distortions, the slowdown is amplified whenever sales are more concentrated than production cost shares. Using firm- and industry-level data from Sweden, the United States, and European economies, I find empirical evidence consistent with these predictions. The quantified version of the model predicts that a ten-percentage-point rise in the Herfindahl index of sales concentration reduces five-year productivity growth by about 0.6 percentage points in the efficient benchmark and that a similar rise in the gap between the Herfindahl indices of sales and costs reduces five-year growth by roughly 2 percentage points. The calibrated model also reproduces the observed size dependence of firm growth rates, matching the decline in volatility and skewness with firm size. These findings highlight the importance of micro-reallocation for understanding how market structure shapes productivity growth across sectors and, potentially, aggregate economies.

### Inflation Persistence and a New Phillips Curve
(with Chek Choi, Marcus Hagedor and Kurt Mitman)

Auclert et al. (2024) recently argued that, to first order, menu-costs models deliver the same New Keynesian Phillips Curves as time-dependent models in response to AR(1) shocks. We show here that when considering a broader class of shocks, menu-costs models can generate qualitatively and quantitatively different Phillips curves than implied by time-dependent models. Shocks to the growth rate of nominal demand generate inflation persistence in the model, in line with the data, but at odds with the standard time-dependent NKPC. Changes in the extensive margin of price adjustment in the menu-cost model generate history dependence that is captured by the lagged inflation rate. Once we control for lagged nominal demand growth, the explanatory power of lagged inflation drops significantly. The reason is that nominal demand growth is a second determinant of inflation in the Phillips curve in menu-cost models and inflation therefore inherits the persistence of the process for nominal demand.
